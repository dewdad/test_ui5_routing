# Test OpenUI5 Tiles app with Component-based Routing

This is a test program based on the boilerplate Tiles app generated by the yeoman openui5 generator. It shows how the component-based routing architecture can be used. All navigation is delegated to the router. View creation is also delegated to the router in this instance; however it does not need to be so. By delegating to the router we do get just-in-time view creation which would be good if there were lots of views that would slow the app down on startup. For a small number of view; however its probably better to load them up front.

## Issues
The app uses a local mock of the Northwind OData service. There seems to be an issue with this as the modle bindings do not work when the app is instantiated from a view route. Note that the UI5 SDK demo apps also fail. However - if I redirect this to use the real Northwind OData service hosted by Microsoft then it does work properly. The issue seems to be purely with local data sources.
Also - note that you can have issues with the Northwind service and thats why I started using the mock service (which SAP provides with the UI5 SDK) instead when running on Windows.
