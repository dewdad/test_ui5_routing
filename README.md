# Test OpenUI5 Tiles app with Component-based Routing

This is a test program based on the boilerplate Tiles app generated by the yeoman openui5 generator. It shows how the component-based routing architecture can be used. All navigation is delegated to the router. View creation is also delegated to the router in this instance; however it does not need to be so. By delegating to the router we do get just-in-time view creation which would be good if there were lots of views that would slow the app down on startup. For a small number of view; however its probably better to load them up front.
